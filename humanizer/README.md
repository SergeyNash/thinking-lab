# Portable Russian Humanizer

This layer defines reusable Russian editing rules that can be used outside
Thinking Lab.

It is not a research system, content strategy, or platform workflow. It is a
portable layer for making Russian text more natural, specific, and human while
preserving the author's meaning.

## What It Does

The humanizer helps edit:

- articles;
- posts;
- book chapters;
- business texts;
- essays;
- chat replies;
- drafts that sound too generic or AI-like.

It removes common problems:

- bureaucratic wording;
- English-calque syntax;
- empty intensifiers;
- over-polished rhythm;
- artificial contrast;
- unnecessary lists and headings;
- assistant-like endings;
- typographic habits that make prose feel generated.

---

## What It Does Not Do

The humanizer does not:

- invent missing arguments;
- replace editing judgment;
- add intentional mistakes;
- break grammar to sound human;
- define a product voice;
- run Thinking Lab research;
- decide whether a text should be published.

Project-specific rules belong in voice adapters.

## Core Documents

- `HUMANIZER_CORE.md` contains reusable Russian editing rules.
- `MODES.md` explains how to apply those rules to different kinds of text.
- `VOICE_ADAPTERS.md` explains how to layer a project or author voice on top.

Thinking Lab uses this layer through `communication/HUMANIZER_RULES.md`, which
adds research-first and product/JTBD constraints.

## Basic Use

1. Identify the text mode: `general`, `product_content`, `fiction`,
   `business`, `essay`, or `chat_reply`.
2. Preserve the original meaning and author intent.
3. Apply `HUMANIZER_CORE.md`.
4. Apply a project-specific voice adapter, if one exists.
5. Return the revised text and mention any meaning-level weaknesses.

The default principle:

> Make the text more specific, more causal, and more author-like.
> Do not make it messy for the sake of sounding human.
